#  **Polynomial Calculator** üìê

A **Java-based** polynomial calculator that allows users to input two polynomials, perform selected operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and see the results instantly. The application is designed with an intuitive **GUI interface** for ease of use, and the functionality is thoroughly tested using **JUnit**.

##  **Features**:
- **Polynomial Input**: Easily enter polynomials in standard form (e.g., `3x^2 + 2x - 1`).
- **Operations**: Perform a variety of operations such as:
  - **Addition**
  - **Subtraction**
  - **Multiplication**
  - **Division**
- **Result Display**: Instantly see the result of the operation on the polynomials.
- **JUnit Testing**: Ensure reliability and correctness of all operations via unit tests.
